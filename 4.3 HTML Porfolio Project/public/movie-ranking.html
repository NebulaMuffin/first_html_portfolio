<h1>My Favourite Three Movies</h1>
<h2>Nothing comes close to these 3 gems ❤️</h2>
<hr />
<h3>My Neighbour Totoro</h3>
<p>My ultimate favourite 🤩 It's not very fast or action-packed, but that's why I like it ❤️</p>
<h3>Kiki's Delivery Service</h3>
<p>An anime by Miyazaki like My Neighbour Totoro, however it feels like a different realm with the charm and unique scenery 🐈‍⬛</p>
<h3>From Up On Poppy Hill</h3>
<p>Incredibly calming with an interesting love story (don't quesion it much though 🤫)</p>
